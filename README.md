# Power BI Car Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to visualize car sales data. The dashboard tracks key metrics such as total sales, growth percentage, pre-sale figures, and budget across years (2019-2022). It features interactive elements like year tabs, sales type breakdowns (via pie chart), monthly trends (bar chart), and service categories (horizontal bar chart).

The dashboard includes dynamic car model images that change based on the selected model (e.g., Model1, Model2, Model3). It is enhanced with custom icons and background images for an attractive and professional interface.
